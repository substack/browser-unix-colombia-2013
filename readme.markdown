# unix in the browser

# why

"the web is the operating system"

![web](images/web.png)

write once, run anywhere

the web is the world's most successful universal application vm

![vm](images/vm.png)

if you have a vm...
why not unix!!!!

mostly empty vm

the operating system should be unix

# operating systems

* provide a consistent interface for hardware
(polyfills)

* /dev/audio
* /dev/video

* communication infrastructure

*security

permissions model

```
(user << 6) + (group << 3) + other
```

![permisos](images/permisos.png)

hay muchos grupos para cada funciÃ³n de seguridad

cache manifest bootloader

* package management

# if we can get unix working in the browser...

node is a set of compatability apis for low-level unix syscalls

increasingly, so is the browser!

why not also get it working in windows?

# unix

## everything is a file

level-fs-browser

## pipes

## the usual tools

# terminal

# package managers

we don't need an "app store"
we need a package manager
ideally one with completely vendored installation

(anarchy os image goes here)

mmalecki already started writing one!
